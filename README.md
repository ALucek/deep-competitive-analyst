# Deep Competitive Analyst

<img src="./dca_logo.png" width=200>

Deep Competitive Analyst is a 'deep agent' style LLM assistant built to automate the creation of company profiles and competitive analyses. Built on top of [deepagents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents), [LangGraph Platform](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph-platform), and [Perplexity Search](https://docs.perplexity.ai/getting-started/overview), DCA can perform thorough research autonomously to create detailed business reports in a fraction of the time of a human. It operates for extended periods, dynamically spawning sub-agents to parallelize research tasks and creates the kind of in-depth competitive analysis that usually costs thousands.

Example output from the agent [can be viewed here.](./example_output/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ALucek/deep-competitive-analyst.git
cd deep-competitive-analyst
```

2. Install depencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

3. Create a .env file with the following variables:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT=https://api.smith.langchain.com
LANGSMITH_PROJECT=deep_competitive_analyst
```

3. Launch the agent:

```bash
cd src
uv run langgraph dev  
```

The Deep Competitive Analyst will now be running locally via the langgraph platform and can be integrated into your own compatible interface. It is recommended to use the [deep-agents-ui](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deep-agents-ui) for a quick local interface and local testing.
